# 🕹️ Text-Based Escape Game

A Python-based text adventure game where the player must explore rooms, collect keys and potions, avoid ghosts, and escape through a locked door — all within 5 minutes!

You are a student staying as a paying guest in a mysterious house. Your patron traps you inside, and now you must:

• Explore rooms

• Collect 3 keys to unlock the door

• Avoid ghosts that damage your health

• Use potions to heal

• Escape before time runs out!

## 🎮 How to Play

```
   
Then use commands like:
